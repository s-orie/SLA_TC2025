# Snowline Altitude Analysis in the Himalayas

This repository contains the exact code used for the analyses presented in the paper:

"Contrasting patterns of change in snowline altitude across five Himalayan catchments"

## Overview

The scripts in this repository were used to extract and analyze snowline altitude (SLA) time series across five Himalayan catchments, using satellite imagery (Landsat 5/7/8 and Sentinel-2) via Google Earth Engine (GEE).

## Important Notes

- The code in this repository reflects the exact version used in the publication.
- **Some satellite datasets (e.g., older Landsat TOA collections) are no longer available on GEE**, and the scripts may not run without modification.
- We provide the code as a record of our processing steps and methodology for transparency and reproducibility.
- If you wish to re-run the analysis, we recommend updating the scripts to match currently available GEE datasets.
